# Rails Sessions and Cookies

## Objectives

- Discuss cookies and client storage
- Discuss Rails use of cookies
- Implement Rails flash and session

## Questions

## Notes

- RESTful servers are stateless
  - each request is independent
  - there's no shared information (state) between requests

Why not store state in the database
  
  - temporary info
  - would require a bunch of additional models
