# Intro to Testing

## Objectives

- discuss the need for testing
- introduce RSpec
- define Test-Driven development (TDD)

## Questions

- what's the deal with `#describe`?
- -ff is it an rspec flag?
- how do spec files connect to the code they're testing?

## Notes

- describe - description for us, the devs, to categorize our specs
- subject - creates a variable to test with
- it - hold the specific test expectations
- let - assigns a new variable in a describe block
- context - like describe but within method describe blocks for different scenarios

### TDD
Test driven development

- write tests before application code
- "red, green, refactor"
  - red - tests failing
  - green - just enough code to get tests to pass
  - refactor - improve code for efficiency and readability
