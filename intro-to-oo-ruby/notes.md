# Intro to Object Oriented Programming in Ruby

## Objectives

- Define `object` in programming
- Create and instantiate Ruby Classes
  - instance methods
  - class methods (`self`)
  - attribute readers and writers
- Explain scope in the context of Ruby classes

## Questions

- `attr_accessor` vs `attr_reader` or `attr_writer`?
  - setter vs getter

## Notes

Objects may contain:

- attributes: data describing the object
- methods: actions that an object can perform

IRB Interactive Ruby Shell

attr_accessor - allows attribute to be both read and written
attr_reader - allows attribute to be read
attr_writer - allows attribute to be written


`self` changes value depending on it's context
