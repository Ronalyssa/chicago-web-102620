# Hashketball Review

## Objectives

- review data types in Ruby
- review common hash and array methods
- define "single responsibility" and refactor
- discuss debugging & problem solving strategies

## Questions

## Notes

### Ruby Methods

`Hash#values` -> takes a hash and returns an array of it's values
`Array#each` -> taxes an array and executes behavior defined in the block against each one
`Array#map` -> takes an array of x items and returns an array of x items based on behavior defined in a block block
`Array#flatten` -> takes a nested array and flattens it into an array that isn't nested
`Array#select` -> takes an array and returns an array of items that meet the condition
`Array#find` -> takes an array and returns the first item that meets the condition

### Terms

abstraction - the process of creating accessible interfaces which obscure complex behaviors
single responsibility principle - every method/class/file/directory should be focused and be responsible for one thing only
